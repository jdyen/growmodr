#' Fit and validate growth models for a suite of common growth curves
#' 
#' growmodr allows you to fit growth models to size-at-age data and to 
#'   validate these models with cross validation or common model
#'   comparison tools (r2, WAIC, loo).
#'   
#' The main function you'll use in \pkg{growmodr} is \code{\link{growmod}}
#'   and its associated methods, particularly the \code{\link{validate}} method.
#'   See the package vignettes and help files for examples of fitting growth
#'   curves to data.
