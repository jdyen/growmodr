#' Fit and validate growth models for a suite of common growth curves
#' 
#' growmod allows you to fit growth models to size-at-age data and to 
#'   validate these models with cross validation or common model
#'   comparison tools (r2, WAIC, loo).
#'   
#' The main function you'll use in \pkg{growmod} is \code{\link{growmod}}
#'   and its associated methods. See the package vignettes and help
#'   files for examples of fitting growth curves to data.
