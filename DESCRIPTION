Description: R package to fit growth models to data on size at age. Supports
    multiple model types, including standard growth-curve fitting, growth
    curves that differ among blocks in a data set (e.g. different growth
    curves for each species in a data set), and hierarchical models of growth
    curves where curve parameters depend on a predictor variables (e.g., a
    species's traits). Includes methods for model validation, comparison,
    and plotting.
